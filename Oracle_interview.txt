
1) Shell script to count how many executable commands are in your current PATH.
#!/bin/bash
find </path> -type -f executable -print | wc -l

2) You need to create a backup script which will run every hour, how do you make sure that your script is not already running when you run the script - write a short script that will handle this scenario and will exit with the message “Previous <command> is still running” in case the script is still in the background so that there is no conflict.
* 1/* * * * sh shell.sh
vi shell.sh
if [ -f /path.sh]; then
echo "script is present"
  if [ ps -ef | grep path.sh]; then
      echo "script is still running"
